# Working Agreement (Codex)

## Two-phase workflow (MANDATORY)

1. Planning phase (NO edits):

-   Do not modify any files.
-   Do not run commands that change state.
-   Provide: (a) proposed design/approach, (b) files to change, (c) step-by-step
    plan, (d) risks & alternatives, (e) test plan, (f) rollback plan.
-   Ask for explicit approval at the end.

2. Execution phase (edits allowed ONLY after approval):

-   Only proceed when I reply exactly: "开始修改" (or "APPLY").
-   After changes, summarize edits file-by-file and provide how to verify.
-   If anything is ambiguous, stop and ask before editing.

## Output format

-   Use headings: Goals / Design / Change list / Risks / Tests / Rollback /
    Questions
